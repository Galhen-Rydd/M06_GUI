Welcome to my Game Manager!
Made by: Pau Tudela Lorenzo

Here are some basic notes and instructions explaining how this manager works:
First the manager loads all the games from the sql table, if you want to change what you are seeing press the buttons Platforms or Companies.
To do searches first select what are you searching and enter either the Key (Game), Company ID (Company) or Platform ID (Platform).
To start editing the table we first need to log in, the user that is created by default in the database is admin with the password admin.
To insert games you only need to enter the key, title, genres (Make sure the values are separated by comas and are typed as they are in the enum Genre), Description, Company ID and Platform ID.
For Platforms you need to enter Platform ID, Platform (Name of the platform) and Company ID.
And for Company you need to enter Company ID and Company (Name of the company)
To select what operation to do please select and option from the checkbox.
The button clear values clears the text from the textboxes so the user doesn't have to delete them all manually.
If you get only one result when searching the data from the search will be inserted into the textboxes.
